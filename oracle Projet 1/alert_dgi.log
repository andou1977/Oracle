WARNING: The following temporary tablespaces contain no files.
         This condition can occur when a backup controlfile has
         been restored.  It may be necessary to add files to these
         tablespaces.  That can be done using the SQL statement:
 
         ALTER TABLESPACE <tablespace_name> ADD TEMPFILE
 
         Alternatively, if these temporary tablespaces are no longer
         needed, then they can be dropped.
